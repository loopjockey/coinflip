Make the label component sit down the bottom, following the coin closest to the middle, giving more surface area to give information about the coin, it can also be the info for the user to know what to do next..


On the gameplay end, add a new "flip" animation where the coin flips a few times, then falls on a specific side. This means we can then reuse the coin display for both gameplay and unboxing.
